## ðŸš€ Projects

### **Medical Large Language Model (LLM)**

**Problem Statement**: Enhance patient outcome predictions and treatment planning in healthcare.

**Solution**: Developed a Proof of Concept (POC) to evaluate whether pre-existing models or a newly trained model could better predict patient outcomes. Utilized a deep learning-based medical LLM with Python, Hugging Face transformers, and PyTorch, trained on longitudinal patient data to refine health trajectory understanding.

**Outcome**: Successfully demonstrated that the LLM could provide more accurate patient outcome predictions, leading to improved treatment planning and decision-making in clinical settings.

### **Containerized Data Ingestion Pipeline with CI/CD**

**Overview**: Modernized the data ingestion pipeline with a CI/CD workflow using Docker, ECR, ECS, and Airflow.

**Solution**:

- **Containerization**: Used Docker to containerize the data ingestion pipeline, enhancing scalability and portability.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the pipeline on AWS with Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Elastic Container Service (ECS).
- **Orchestration**: Integrated Apache Airflow for automating and streamlining the data ingestion process.
- **Data Quality Management**: Incorporated DQM checks to ensure data integrity and accuracy during ingestion.

**Outcome**: Improved pipeline efficiency, speed, and reliability, ensuring high data quality and supporting better decision-making.

### **Vendor Data Ingestion Initiative**

**Problem Statement**: Integrate new quarterly vendor data into EVERSANA's existing database efficiently.

**Solution**: Developed automated Python and SQL scripts and schemas for efficient data ingestion and integration.

**Outcome**: Enhanced process efficiency and system reliability, reducing manual oversight and integration errors.

---

### **Improving Data Quality of EMR Patients Using Unstructured Data**

**Overview**: Aimed to improve Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data quality by leveraging unstructured data sources like prescriptions and doctor's notes.

**Solution**:

- **Data Extraction**: Applied the Med7 Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract key entities from unstructured data.
- **Data Integration**: Structured and integrated the extracted data into existing EMR datasets to enrich patient records.

**Outcome**: Successfully extracted about **60%** of relevant data from unstructured sources, enhancing EMR quality and completeness.

---

### **Automated Quality Assurance (DQM)**

**Problem Statement**: Manual quality checking for data refresh was time-consuming, taking up to a week for **12 TB** of data.

**Solution**: Implemented an Automated Quality Assurance Framework using Python and SQL for efficient data validation and integrity checks.

**Outcome**: Reduced the quality checking time from a week to a few days, significantly improving the efficiency of the data refresh process.
